This project is a team effort journey, brought to life thanks to a class in college. We used Python, Pandas and Scikit-learn to make a Machine Learning model that would recommend films based on the user favorite movies. <br />The app frontend was made with Flutter and we also added features like authentication using Google providers, saving your favorite movies with Firestore and search for the most popular movies using TMDB API.
