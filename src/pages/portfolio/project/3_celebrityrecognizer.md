This project is a CLI tool that i made to play with AWS Rekognition. It uses Python to interact with the AWS API and it's pretty simple to use. To add more complexity, i used Cognito to authenticate the user. Because this, i also had to use API Gateway and Lambda functions. This was my first experience with AWS and i really liked it. I'm planning to use it more in the future.
